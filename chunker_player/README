This is the test package for the Napa-Wine player.
You can download the lates version of this player from
http://www.napa-wine.eu/~napawine/napabot/

Download and uncompress the tar.gz archive

tar xvfz napaplayer.tar.gz

get into the napaplayer folder

cd napaplayer

If you run the chunker_player executable without parameters, it will print
a brief list of accepted input parameters:

queue_thresh
httpd_port
silentMode
LossTracesFilenameSuffix
ChannelName
<YUVFilename>

Parameters have to be issued on the command line in the correct order.
Example run:
./chunker_player 30 45454 0 losses.txt UL_BBC_Torino


Explanation of parameters.
1st parameter: queue_thresh: size of the playout buffer in number of frames, i.e. 40.

2nd parameter: httpd_port: the player receives chunks from the offerstreamer
peer through this http port.

3rd parameter: silentMode: it can be 0 or 1. One means run in silent mode, that is
without graphical interface, so that multiple players can be run, provided you
give different port numbers, and statistics can be collected also. This way the
player can also be run remotely via ssh.

4th parameter: LossTracesFilenameSuffix: if you give for example losses.txt as a
value, the two files video_losses.txt and audio_losses.txt will be created.
These trace files record the sequence number of all lost frames as seen from
the player point of view.

5th parameter: ChannelName: the name of the channel/swarm to tune in. See the
channels.conf file for configuring the channels, and a list of available channels.

6th parameter: <YUVFilename>: this parameter is optional. If you give it, a
YUV file will be created with the received video, as it is played. This is a raw
uncompressed sequence of frames, and it can get very big.

The player takes care of spawning the peer client with the correct parameters,
and of killing it on channel switch. The offerstreamer parameters can be fine
tuned via the channels.conf file, by editing the LaunchString of each channel.
Beware that -C, -P, -and F offerstreamer parameters are added dynamically and
must not be issued inside the LaunchString.
